# Technical Details

- In order to view your files in browser, Sree configures bucket CORS for you when creating buckets. See [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/browser-configuring.html#Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing__CORS_) for more details.
- Files uploaded via Sree are set as `public-read` as default so as to be downloadable. ~~Future versions of Sree will make file ACLs configurable.~~(Supported now!)
