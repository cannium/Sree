- Region: The region you would use
- Access Key ID & Secret Access Key: Key and secret generated by service provider

Configurations are saved in your browser and not disclosed to anyone else.

# Technical Details

- In order to view your files in browser, Sree configures bucket CORS for you when creating buckets. See [Configuring CORS for an Amazon S3 Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/browser-configuring.html#Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing__CORS_) for more details.
- Files uploaded via Sree are set as `public-read` as default so as to be downloadable. Future versions of Sree will make file ACLs configurable.
